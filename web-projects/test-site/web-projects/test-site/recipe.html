<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

 <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
</p>
<p>
  Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
</p>
<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<p><ul>
<li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
<li>175g of tahini</li>
<li>6 <em>sundried tomatoes</em></li>
<li>Half a red pepper</li>
<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
<li>A dash of olive oil</li>
</ul></p>
 <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li> 
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li> 
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li> 
  <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste
    <ul>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li> 
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li> 
    </ul>
</ol>
 <p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

 <h2>Storage</h2>
</div>

<hp>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>
  Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
